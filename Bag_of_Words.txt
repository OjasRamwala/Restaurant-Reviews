Bag Of Words Model explanation:
  The bag-of-words model is simple to understand and implement. 
  It is a way of extracting features from the text for use in machine learning algorithms.
  In this approach, we use the tokenized words for each observation and find out the frequency of each token.
  We treat each sentence as a separate document and we make a list of all words from all the four documents excluding the punctuation.
  The next step is to the create vectors. Vectors convert text that can be used by the machine learning algorithm.
  The process of converting NLP text into numbers is called vectorization in ML. Different ways to convert text into vectors are:-
    (1)Counting the number of times each word appears in a document.
    (2)Calculating the frequency that each word appears in a document out of all the words in the document.
  CountVectorizer works on Terms Frequency i.e. counting the occurrences of tokens and building a sparse matrix of documents x tokens.
Applications-  Bag-of-words model is mainly used as a tool of feature generation.
               After transforming the text into a "bag of words", we can calculate various measures to characterize the text.
               The most common type of characteristics, or features calculated from the Bag-of-words model is term frequency, namely, the number of times a term appears in the text.
